# Jeoperdy

Hello. This is Jeoperdy. It's very similar to the gameshow. You'll need to know how to play that particular game in order to use this.
This app is mostly for discord and stuff. Anyways, here's how to use it.

- Clicking on a number in the grid will make it disappear. Do this after a player has answered that specific question. 
Clicking it again will make the number appear again.

- Clicking the title card is a button. It will access the settings menu where you can set player names and category text.

- Clicking the left side of the category's bar will open the player menu. It will show the player names and where you can set their points. 

- Clicking the right side of the category bar will apply catagory name changes.

  Opening the player menu will update player names. Daily Double is allocated randomly upon startup.
